Source code of *Spatiotemporally adaptive optimization of nonpharmaceutical interventions for influenza via a SEIQR-Dueling DQN framework*

# Project Description

This project implements a SEIQR-Dueling DQN framework for spatiotemporally adaptive optimization of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for influenza. It aims to address the challenges of balancing infection control and socioeconomic costs while accounting for regional heterogeneity in influenza transmission dynamics.

# Usage
### Data Preparation
1. Ensure that the climatic data (`weatherSichuan.xlsx`) is available in the root directory.
2. Modify the data preprocessing scripts (`SEIQR.py` and `SEIQR_random.py`) if necessary to match your data structure.

Note: Some parameters are suggested to be calculated on your own to fit your personalized goals and setup environment.
